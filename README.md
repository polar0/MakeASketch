# MakeASketch

Built by me, thanks to what I've learned from The Odin Project.

- Grid size up to 100 x 100 (10 000 pixels)
- Regular painting, erasing, rainbow mode
- Shadow function to darken or lighten pixels
<hr>

- Change the background color at any time
- Replace any color from your sketch

- Export your sketch to clipboard to finish it later
- Then import it into the app and see it appear right away!

Please feel free to give me any advice on how to improve my code, or just on any other way I could have done any of this!
