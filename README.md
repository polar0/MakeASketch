Features :

- Regular painting, erasing, rainbow mode
- Shadow function to darken or lighten pixels

Extras :

- Change the background color at any time
- Replace any color from your sketch
- Export your sketch to clipboard to finish it later
- Then import it into the app and see it appear right away!

What I've learned :

- Manipulating DOM elements with JavaScript
