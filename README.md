# MakeASketch

Built by me, thanks to what I've learned from The Odin Project.
<br /><br />

- Grid size up to 100 x 100 (10 000 pixels)
- Regular painting, erasing, rainbow mode
- Shadow function to darken or lighten pixels
  <br /><br />

- Change the background color at any time
- Replace any color from your sketch
  <br /><br />

- Export your sketch to clipboard to finish it later
- Then import it into the app and see it appear right away!
  <br /><br />

Please feel free to give me any advice on how to improve my code, or just on any other way I could have done any of this!
